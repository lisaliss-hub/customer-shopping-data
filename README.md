# Customer Shopping Data Analysis
This project explores customer shopping behavior using transactional and demographic data. It applies data science techniques to get insights, segment customers and build predictive models for spending behaviour.

## **Project Overview**
- Clean analyze acustomer shopping dataset
- Perform feature engineering and handle outliers
- Use RFM analysis for loyalty segmentation
- Apply K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
- Build a Random Forest Model to predict total spend
- Visualize key insights and generate a report

## Dataset Description
  The dataset includes:
  -'Customer_id'
  -'Invoice_no'
  -'Invoice_date'
  -'Gender'
  -'Age'
  -'Category'
  -'Shopping_mall'
  -'Quantity '
  -'Price'
Additional features like 'Total_amount', 'RFM scores' and 'Clusters' were created through preprocessing and analysis.

## **Key Techniques Used**
- Data cleaning and preprocesing
- Feature Engineering: Total spend, RFM metrics
- RFM Analysis: Recency, Frequency, Monetary
- Clustering: K-Means for customer segmentation
- Modeling: Random Forest Regression
- Visualization: Spending trends, category insights, customer segments
- Reporting

## Tools and Libraries used
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- ReportLab (for PDF report)

## **How to Run**
1. Clone the repo:
   '''bash
   git clone
   https://github.com/lisaliss-hub/customer-shopping-data.git
   cd customer-shopping-data

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer purchase behavior:
 
  ** Key Insights and recommendations**
1. Female customers made more purchases and spent more in total.
2. Top categories and malls were identified by sales volume and revenue
3. RFM analysis helped identify loyal and at-risk customers.
4. Customer segmentation revealed distinct groups with different shopping behaviours.
5. Random Forest model was able to predict customer spending using RFM and demographics.
